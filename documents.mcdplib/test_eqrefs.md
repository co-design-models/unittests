(if it exists) of the set of fixed points of~$f$:
\begin{equation}
x = y .\label{eq:lfp-one}
\end{equation}
The equality in \eqref{lfp-one} can be relaxed to ``$xxx$''.

The equality in \ref{eq:lfp-one} can be relaxed to ``$xxx$''.


The least fixed point need not exist. Monotonicity of the map~$f$
plus completeness is sufficient to ensure existence.
