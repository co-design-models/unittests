\begin{example}
(Stereo reconstruction) Progressive reconstruction system (e.g.,~\cite{locher16progressive}),
which start with a coarse approximation of the solution that is progressively
refined, are described by a smooth relation between the \F{resolution}
and the \R{latency} to obtain the answer~(\prettyref{fig:progressive}).
A similar relation characterizes any anytime algorithms in other domains,
such as robot motion planning.
\end{example}
